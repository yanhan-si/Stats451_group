## Introduction

In this project, we performed Bayesian methods on a financial time series data set, examining the log daily return and the volatility  of the Bitcoin price. The methods we used include generalized auto-regressive conditional heteroskedasticity(GARCH) model,  stochastic volatility(SV) model, and hidden Markov model(HMM). All three models yield similar prediction results on the test data. The mean log return is about 0.008.
